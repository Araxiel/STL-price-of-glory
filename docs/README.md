# Price of Glory

> [!NOTE]
> **26/09/24**: Looking at this mod, I had some great plans for it. Some of the foundations I came up with here showcase a great deal of planned modularity. I think this mod's foundational indent was a frustration with mods that "add 600 events" or "80 new policiies", which massively range in balance, quality and writing. I also wanted some more internal politics and shifting of ethics. Like some of my other Stellaris (and HoI4 mods like Peer Pressure), there is a great desire here to have more dynamic and shifting internal politics, driven by the population. And like many aspects, Victoria 3 here delivered ~5 years later what I tried to shoehorn into these games with these mods.

> This mod is massively unfinished, but some of the coding foundations here are interesting and I remember learning a lot about modularity, randomisation and documentation while making this back in the days.
